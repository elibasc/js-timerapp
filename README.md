# JavaScript Timer App
*Exercise from "The Modern Javascript Bootcamp" by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider*

My approach to solve some problems of the app after coding it with the instructor.
Worked on the styling too, in order to practice CSS and learn more about svg.

*Notes: the app doesn't seems to work well on Firefox and Safari, the app is built with setInterval() which lags on some browsers so the countdown takes longer*
